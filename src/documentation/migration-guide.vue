p Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€

title-link(h2 anchor="new") New Features &amp; Improvements
p.
  Vue Cal has been completely #[strong refactored from the ground up], using the Composition API and
  composables, while focusing on two key aspects: #[strong performance and flexibility].
  You will continue to benefit from all the features of previous versions, now enhanced with new functionality and improvements.
ul
  li #[strong Performance-oriented]: faster and more efficient than ever.
  li Highly adapted and practical for use with the Composition API.
  li #[strong Exposes the view] for external use.
  li #[strong Exposes all date utilities] for external use.
  li Take advantage of #[strong Date prototypes whenever and wherever] you want, even before the calendar is created or mounted.
  li #[strong Modernized default UI] for a more contemporary appearance, designed to save you time and effort in customization and usability.
  li #[strong Custom days view] to display a custom number of days with an adaptive grid layout.
  li #[strong Flexible grid-based layout] for enhanced customization.
  li #[strong Easy theming] with support for dark and light themes, plus CSS variables.
  li #[strong All-direction sticky headers]: Sticky headers and sticky time bars simultaneously - achieved purely with CSS.
  li Directly #[strong preload a locale externally] to avoid handling Promises.
  li Reworked options for #[strong more intuitive usage].
  li Fine-grain event deletion in 3 stages: 1. show the delete button, 2. delete the event from the view, 3. delete the event in the source of truth.
  li Events are deleted by their internal ID, or by a provided custom key-value pair (e.g. `{ id: 123 }`).
  li New animation on event deletion.
  li New event v-model for more control over events.
  li More intuitive and flexible event creation.
  li More events are emitted for more control and customization. E.g. #[code cell-drag-start], #[code cell-drag], #[code cell-drag-end], #[code cell-delayed-click], #[code cell-hold], #[code event-create], #[code event-delete], #[code event-delayed-click], #[code event-hold], #[code event-resize-start], #[code event-resize], #[code event-resize-end], #[code event-drag-start], #[code event-drag], #[code event-drag-end].
  li Any valid event listener will be forwarder to cells and events. E.g. #[code cell-click], #[code cell-dblclick], #[code cell-drag-start], #[code cell-drag], #[code cell-drag-end], #[code cell-hold], #[code cell-mousedown], #[code cell-touchstart], #[code cell-mouseenter], #[code cell-mouseleave], #[code cell-contextmenu], #[code event-create], #[code event-click], #[code event-dblclick], #[code event-drag-start], #[code event-drag], #[code event-drag-end], #[code event-drop], #[code event-resize-start], #[code event-resize], #[code event-resize-end], #[code event-mouseenter], #[code event-mouseleave], #[code event-contextmenu].
  li Ability to reject event creation.
  li Ability to reject event drag and drop and event resize.
  li Exposed event overlap detection for more external control.
  li Supports dynamic event colors.

title-link(h2 anchor="global-changes") Global Changes
ul
  li
    p The Date prototypes are not injected by default anymore, and very easy to add, you control when:
    ssh-pre(language="js" :dark="store.darkMode").
      import { addDatePrototypes } from '@/vue-cal'

      addDatePrototypes()
  li.
    No more header right margin to align with body if there is a scrollbar. Now the Vue Cal body is
    scrollable with sticky headers (weekdays and time column) in both axis.
  li.
    The selected date and view date are now 2 separated variables: #[code selectedDate] and
    #[code viewDate], so they can be updated distinctly without the side effect of the other.
  li
    p.
      You can now directly attach any valid DOM event you want to the events and cells.
      It only needs to start respectively with #[code event-] and #[code cell-] to be forwarded.#[br]
      Additionnally, new events are fired on more complex circumstances: #[code cell-drag-start],
      #[code cell-drag], #[code cell-drag-end], #[code cell-delayed-click], #[code cell-hold],
      #[code event-create], #[code event-delete], #[code event-delayed-click], #[code event-hold],
      #[code event-resize-start], #[code event-resize], #[code event-resize-end],
      #[code event-drag-start], #[code event-drag], #[code event-drag-end].
    p For instance:
    ssh-pre(language="html-vue" :dark="store.darkMode").
      &lt;vue-cal
        @cell-click="log('cell-click', $event)"
        @cell-dblclick="log('cell-dblclick', $event)"
        @cell-drag-start="log('cell-drag-start', $event)"
        @cell-drag="log('cell-drag', $event)"
        @cell-drag-end="log('cell-drag-end', $event)"
        @cell-hold="log('cell-hold', $event)"
        @cell-mousedown="log('cell-mousedown', $event)"
        @cell-touchstart="log('cell-touchstart', $event)"
        @cell-mouseenter="log('cell-mouseenter', $event)"
        @cell-mouseleave="log('cell-mouseleave', $event)"
        @cell-contextmenu="log('cell-contextmenu', $event)"
        @event-create="eventCreation.open"
        @event-click="log('event-click', $event)"
        @event-dblclick="log('event-dblclick', $event)"
        @event-drag-start="log('event-drag-start', $event)"
        @event-drag="log('event-drag', $event)"
        @event-drag-end="log('event-drag-end', $event)"
        @event-drop="log('event-drop', $event)"
        @event-resize-start="log('event-resize-start', $event)"
        @event-resize="log('event-resize', $event)"
        @event-resize-end="log('event-resize-end', $event)"
        @event-mouseenter="log('event-mouseenter', $event)"
        @event-mouseleave="log('event-mouseleave', $event)"
        @event-contextmenu="log('event-contextmenu', $event)"&gt;
      &lt;/vue-cal&gt;

  li.
    Navigation by clicking or double-clicking cell has been removed, you can add this yourself
    now that you can directly attach any valid DOM event to the cell.
  li.
    The default theme is used by default. No need to add the class anymore, but you can disable and
    style from scratch by setting the #[code theme] prop to false or a different class string.
  li
    | Scrolling to time is now built-in and accessible from the view object. 3 functions are available:
    ul
      li scrollTop()
      li scrollToTime(minutes)
      li scrollToCurrentTime()
  li #[code .vuecal--full-height-delete] class was removed
  li #[code #no-event] slot was removed
  li #[code #week-numbers-cell] slot was renamed #[code #week-number]
  li.

    #[code .vuecal__event--ghost] (as commonly named), and #[code .vuecal__event--static]
    was renamed #[code .vuecal__event--original]
